.SH NAME
inkjet \- Create interactive CLIs and execute Markdown
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]inkjet\f[R]
[\-\-interactive][\-\-preview][\-\-help][\-\-version][\-\-inkfile=inkjet.md]
\f[I]subcommand\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
With \f[CR]inkjet\f[R] you can build interactive CLIs from your existing
Markdown.
These CLIs can be as simple as a list of common tasks such as
\f[CR]test\f[R], \f[CR]build\f[R], and \f[CR]lint\f[R] or as complex
applications with subcommands, flags, and options.
All of this defined in a simple Markdown file that is both a
\f[B]human\-readable document\f[R] and a \f[B]command definition\f[R]!
Your code is documentation and your documentation is code.
Because Markdown is documentation focused, the format encourages
descriptive text.
This allows others to easily get started with your project\(cqs
development setup by simply reading your \f[CR]inkjet.md\f[R].
.SH USE CASES
.SS Rapid CLI development
Inkjet is the fastest path to building and distributing custom command
line apps.
Because you ship a single Markdown file, you can distribute it with any
web server.
You can quickly convert your bash aliases to a CLI interface or use
multiple languages to build an advanced app.
It is all wrapped up with your documentation in a single readable file.
.SS Project specific tasks
You have a project with a bunch of random build and development scripts
or an unwieldy \f[CR]Makefile\f[R].
Simplify by having a single, readable file for your team members to add
and modify existing tasks.
.SS Global system utility
You want a global utility CLI for various system tasks such as backing
up directories or renaming multiple files.
This is easily possible by making a bash alias for
\f[CR]inkjet \-\-inkfile \(ti/my\-global\-inkjet.md\f[R].
.SS Executable interactive tutorials and guides
Blog posts and tutorials often contain text with blocks of code walking
the reader through the process of creating or installing an application
or using a project.
Markdown is commonly used as the authoring format for these guides.
Using Inkjet\(cqs interactive capabilities, it is simple to take an
existing tutorial and distribute an executable documentation file.
Users can download your tutorial and read it, preview code blocks, and
execute each step inside their terminals.
.SH INSTALLATION
.SS Using Homebrew
Homebrew is the preferred method to install \f[CR]inkjet\f[R] and keep
it updated on macOS.
.IP
.EX
brew install brandonkal/tap/inkjet
.EE
.SS Debian Repository
\c
.UR https://git.kalinow.ski/kiterun/-/packages/debian/inkjet
My Debian repository
.UE \c
\ is the preferred way to install \f[CR]inkjet\f[R] on Linux.
It includes shell completions and the man page.
See how to configure the debian package here and then run
\f[CR]sudo apt install inkjet\f[R]
.SS Pre\-compiled binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows
Head to the Releases and look for the latest published version.
Under \f[B]Assets\f[R] you\(cqll see zips available for download for
Linux, macOS, and Windows.
Once downloaded, you can extract them and then move the
\f[CR]inkjet\f[R] binary to somewhere accessible in your
\f[CR]$PATH\f[R] like \f[CR]mv inkjet /usr/local/bin\f[R].
.SS From source
If you prefer to build from source, clone this repo.
The entire build script is in inkjet.md.
The Linux build can also be run via the Earthfile script.
.SH GETTING STARTED
First, define a simple \f[CR]inkjet.md\f[R] in your project root.

.SH FEATURES
.SS Interactive execution mode
Prefixing a subcommand with the interactive flag \f[CR]\-i\f[R] executes
the command interactively.
.PP
In interactive mode:
.IP "1." 3
The command\(cqs Markdown is rendered to the terminal as rich text
support.
.IP "2." 3
If any flags or options are specified in the spec, Inkjet will prompt
the user for those parameters.
.IP "3." 3
The user will be given the option to execute the step or preview the
code block.
.IP "4." 3
Required parameters will have \(lq*\(rq.
If a default exits it will be shown in the prompt.
Hitting enter will select the default.
.PP
Interactive execution mode is useful for tutorial guides or when you are
not sure what options or flag parameters are required.
.SS Preview mode
Prefix a subcommand with the preview flag \f[CR]\-p\f[R] to extract code
from the specified task\(cqs code block.
If \c
.UR https://github.com/sharkdp/bat
bat
.UE \c
\ is available, it will be used to pretty print the block with syntax
highlighting using your installed theme.
This mode is also useful for copying the block into the pasteboard:
\f[CR]inkjet \-p build | pbcopy\f[R].
.SS Shell completions
Inkjet can generate completions for your shell dynamically.
In this way, you\(cqll get helpful tab completions depending on the
Markdown file.
See the \f[CR]completions\f[R] folder for the bash and fish scripts.
For example the fish script calls
\f[CR]inkjet inkjet\-dynamic\-completions fish | source\f[R].
Your shell may cache results in the short term but generally you can
navigate to different folders and get project\-specific
shell\-completion.
.SS Positional arguments
These are defined beside the command name within
\f[CR](round_brackets)\f[R].
They are required arguments that must be supplied for the command to
run.
An argument may be made optional by including a question mark:
\f[CR](optional_arg?)\f[R].
The argument name is injected into the script\(cqs scope as an
environment variable.
Defaults can be set with an equals sign: \f[CR](port=8080)\f[R].
An arg with a default is naturally optional as well.
.PP
\f[B]Example:\f[R]
.IP
.EX

\f[BI]\(ga\(ga\(ga\f[R]
\f[BI]python \-m SimpleHTTPServer $port\f[R]
\f[BI]\(ga\(ga\(ga\f[R]
.EE
.SS Infinite arguments
An argument can be made to accept infinite arguments by including three
dots: \f[CR](extra...)\f[R].
It can be made optional by including a question mark.
This is best left for the last argument.
Infinite args are collected as a space\-separated string, perfect for
shell expansion.
.PP
\f[B]Example:\f[R]
.IP
.EX
## test (extra_args...?)

\f[BI]\(ga\(ga\(ga\f[R]
\f[BI]cargo test $extra_args\f[R]
\f[BI]\(ga\(ga\(ga\f[R]
.EE
.SS Named flags
You can define a list of named flags for your commands.
The flag name is injected into the script\(cqs scope as an environment
variable.
If a flag name includes a \f[CR]\-\f[R] it will be replaced with an
underscore (i.e.\ \f[CR]\-\-no\-color\f[R] becomes \f[CR]no_color\f[R])
.PP
It is important to note that \f[CR]inkjet\f[R] always injects a very
common \f[CR]boolean\f[R] flag called \f[CR]verbose\f[R] into every
single command even if it\(cqs not declared.
This saves a bit of typing for you!
This means every command implicitly has a \f[CR]\-v\f[R] and
\f[CR]\-\-verbose\f[R] flag available.
Like all \f[CR]boolean\f[R] flags, the value of the \f[CR]$verbose\f[R]
environment variable is either \f[CR]\(dqtrue\(dq\f[R] or simply
unset/non\-existent.
.PP

\f[B]\(ga\(ga\(ga\f[R]sh
echo \(dqHello $name! Port is $port\(dq
echo \(dqTask complete.\(dq
\f[B]\(ga\(ga\(ga\f[R]
.EE
.PP
You can also make your flag expect a numerical value by setting its
\f[CR]type\f[R] to \f[CR]number\f[R].
\f[CR]inkjet\f[R] will automatically validate it as a number for you.
If it fails to validate, \f[CR]inkjet\f[R] will exit with a helpful
error message.
.PP
Flags are optional by default.
Note that adding the word \(lqrequired\(rq to the flag list or shorthand
definition will mark the flag a required parameter.
.PP
\f[B]Example:\f[R]
.IP
.EX
## purchase (price)

echo \(dqTotal: $(($price * $TAX))\(dq
\f[BI]\(ga\(ga\(ga\f[R]
.EE
.SS Subcommands
Nested command structures can easily be created since they are simply
defined by the level of Markdown heading.
H2 (\f[CR]##\f[R]) is where you define your top\-level commands.
Every level after that is a subcommand.
The only requirement is that subcommands must have all ancestor commands
present in their heading.
.PP
\f[B]Example:\f[R]
.IP
.EX
## services

> Commands related to starting, stopping, and restarting services

### services start (service_name)

> Start a service.

\f[BI]\(ga\(ga\(gabash\f[R]
echo \(dqStarting service $service_name\(dq
\f[BI]\(ga\(ga\(ga\f[R]

### services stop (service_name)

> Stop a service.

\f[BI]\(ga\(ga\(gabash\f[R]
echo \(dqStopping service $service_name\(dq
\f[BI]\(ga\(ga\(ga\f[R]

#### services stop all

> Stop everything.

\f[BI]\(ga\(ga\(gabash\f[R]
echo \(dqStopping everything\(dq
\f[BI]\(ga\(ga\(ga\f[R]
.EE
.SS Hidden Subcommands
Simply prefix a subcommand\(cqs name with an underscore to make that
command hidden.
It will not be included in the generated CLI help pages.
.PP
This is useful for blocks of code that need to be shared by several
tasks but should not define a visible user\-callable command.
.SS Aliases and default target
Separate a subcommand name with \f[CR]//\f[R] to define an alias.
.IP
.EX
## lint//default

> Lint the project with clippy

\f[BI]\(ga\(ga\(gash\f[R]
cargo clippy
\f[BI]\(ga\(ga\(ga\f[R]
.EE
.PP
In the above example, simply calling \f[CR]inkjet\f[R] with no arguments
will call the lint command.
.SS Support for other scripting runtimes
On top of shell/bash scripts, \f[CR]inkjet\f[R] also supports using
node, Python, Ruby, PHP, yaegi, and deno as scripting runtimes.
This gives you the freedom to choose the right tool for the specific
task at hand.
For example, let\(cqs say you have a \f[CR]serve\f[R] command and a
\f[CR]snapshot\f[R] command.
You could choose python to \f[CR]serve\f[R] a simple directory and maybe
node to run a puppeteer script that generates a png \f[CR]snapshot\f[R]
of each page.
If required, you can even specify a custom shebang.
.PP
For Python, Linux and Mac will search for a \f[CR]python3\f[R] binary
while on Windows, Inkjet expects a \f[CR]python\f[R] binary.

.SS Windows support
If bash is available in your PATH (for example via Git Bash), Inkjet can
use it.
Alternatively, you can add Powershell, Batch, or Cmd code blocks
alongside the Linux/macOS code block.
Depending on which platform this runs on, the correct code block will be
executed.

.SS Automatic help and usage output
You don\(cqt have to spend time writing out help info manually.
\f[CR]inkjet\f[R] uses your command descriptions and options to
automatically generate help output.
For every command, it adds the \f[CR]\-h\f[R] and \f[CR]\-\-help\f[R]
flags.
.PP
\f[B]Example:\f[R]

  \-r, \-\-restart  Restart this service if it\(aqs already running
  \-w, \-\-watch    Restart a service on file change
.EE
.SS Directives
You can change how parsing occurs by including some special directives
in the Markdown file.
Most of the time, I don\(cqt use these but they are available to you for
advanced use cases.
.SS inkjet_sort: false
By default, subcommands in the help output are listed in the same order
they are defined in the Markdown file.
Users can decide to instead have subcommands sorted alphabetically by
defining this directive.
As an example, if you are using inkjet to distribute a CLI of code
snippets, sorted help would make sense.
For projects, you may want the order to be as defined (e.g., publish
comes after test).
.SS inkjet_fixed_dir: false
When you run an inkjet command from a project subdirectory, inkjet will
by default search up the tree to find an \f[CR]inkjet.md\f[R] file.
In order for commands to work as expected, scripts execute as if their
working directory was the same as the location of the
\f[CR]inkjet.md\f[R] file that defined them.
Similarly, if you call Inkjet with
\f[CR]\-\-inkfile tests/inkjet.md\f[R], your commands will execute as if
the working directory was \f[CR]tests\f[R].
If this is not desired, simply include the
\f[CR]inkjet_fixed_dir: false\f[R] directive in the file to have the
working directory match your current directory.
.SS inkjet_import: all
It\(cqs often the case that large projects will have multiple
\f[CR]inkjet.md\f[R] files.
For instance, each service may have its own \f[CR]inkjet.md\f[R] file to
define how to build and test that component.
To enable the import feature, include the text directive
\f[CR]inkjet_import: all\f[R] somewhere within your main
\f[CR]inkjet.md\f[R] file.
If Inkjet discovers this directive in the text, it will find all other
\f[CR]inkjet.md\f[R] files within the current folder and merge them
together before parsing and building out the command tree.
If the imported file has a H1 heading, its commands will appear as a
subcommand of that heading.
If only H2 and below headings are available in the imported file, those
commands will become sibling commands for the parent.
See a merged example here.
.PP
The merge behavior is as follows:
.IP "1." 3
Locate \f[CR]inkjet.md\f[R] files and files ending in
\f[CR].inkjet.md\f[R] within the current folder.
.IP "2." 3
Found \f[CR]inkjet.md\f[R] files are first sorted by directory depth and
then alphabetically.
.IP "3." 3
Merged definitions can override previously defined definitions.
.PP
The override behavior is useful as it enables you to share generic
commands, and then override the generic on a project\-by\-project basis.
.PP
All imported \f[CR]inkjet.md\f[R] files are run as if they were called
directly.
Namely, if \f[CR]inkjet_fixed_dir\f[R] is not set to false, imported
commands will run with their working directory set to the parent
directory of its \f[CR]inkjet.md\f[R] file.
.PP

.SS Running Inkjet from within a script
You can easily call \f[CR]inkjet\f[R] within scripts if you need to
chain commands together.
However, if you plan on running inkjet with a different inkfile, you
should consider using the \f[CR]$INK\f[R] utility (documented below)
instead which allows your scripts to be location\-agnostic.
.PP
Shell scripts execute as if \f[CR]set \-e\f[R] is set.

.SS Exit Codes
If your command exits with an error, \f[CR]inkjet\f[R] will exit with

.SS Running inkjet with a different inkfile
If you\(cqre in a directory that doesn\(cqt have a \f[CR]inkjet.md\f[R]
but you want to reference one somewhere else, you can with the
\f[CR]\-\-inkfile <path_to_inkfile>\f[R] option.
.PP
\f[B]Example:\f[R]
.IP
.EX
inkjet \-\-inkfile \(ti/inkjet.md <subcommand>

.EE
.PP
\f[B]Tip:\f[R] The shorthand alternative to \f[CR]\-\-inkfile\f[R] is
\f[CR]\-c\f[R].
This flag also accepts the text contents of the inkfile or \f[CR]\-\f[R]
to read stdin.
This allows for using Inkjet as an interpreter similar to other shells.
If the value of this flag contains multiple lines, it is interpreted as
the contents.
Otherwise, it is parsed as a filename as usual.
.IP
.EX

.EE
.SH ENVIRONMENT
Inside each script\(cqs execution environment, \f[CR]inkjet\f[R] injects
a few environment variable helpers.
Scripts inherit the environment from your shell.

This is useful when running inkjet within a script.
This variable allows us to call \f[CR]$INK command\f[R] instead of
\f[CR]inkjet \-\-inkfile <path> command\f[R] inside scripts so that they
can be location\-agnostic (not care where they are called from).
This is especially handy for global inkfiles which you may call from
anywhere.
.PP
\f[B]\f[CB]$INKJET\f[B]\f[R]
.PP
This is similar to \f[CR]INK\f[R] above, except it always resolves to
the original \f[CR]inkjet.md\f[R] file.
For instance, You may have some common scripts in the project\(cqs main
\f[CR]inkjet.md\f[R] file and call those scripts in imported
\f[CR]inkjet.md\f[R] files throughout the project.
Note that if you call the imported inkfile directly, it will resolve the
same as \f[CR]$INK\f[R] above.
For this reason, you will see different behavior depending on where you
call the script.
.PP
\f[B]\f[CB]$INK_DIR\f[B]\f[R]
.PP
This variable is an absolute path to the inkfile\(cqs parent directory.
Having the parent directory available allows us to load files relative
to the inkfile itself, which can be useful when you have commands that
depend on other external files.
.PP
\f[B]\f[CB]$INKJET_DIR\f[B]\f[R]
.PP
This is much like \f[CR]INK_DIR\f[R] except it always resolves to the
main \f[CR]inkjet.md\f[R] file\(cqs parent directory.
.PP
\f[B]\f[CB]$INKET_IMPORTED\f[B]\f[R]
.PP
A helper utility that is set to \(lqtrue\(rq if the script was imported
by another \f[CR]inkjet.md\f[R] file.
.PP
\f[B]\f[CB]$NO_COLOR\f[B]\f[R]
.PP
Inkjet respects NO_COLOR to disable colorized output for its own
commands.
